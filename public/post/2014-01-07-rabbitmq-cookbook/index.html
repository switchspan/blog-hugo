I recently finished my first go at being a technical reviewer for a technology book: the <a href="http://bit.ly/1b2OwRo">RabbitMQ Cookbook</a>. I kind of &lsquo;happened&rsquo; into reviewing from some of the tech talks, blog posts and <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/switchspan/rabbitmq-and-easynetq">slide decks</a> I have done on the subject of <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a>. An editorial representative from <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/">Packt Publishing</a> contacted me to see if I would be interested in being a technical reviewer for the upcoming book &ndash; and the adventure began.</p>

<p>A technical reviewer looks primarily at the technical correctness and ease of understanding in each of the chapters. There are plenty of opportunities to offer suggestions for improvements to the author(s).</p>

<p>TBD</p>

<h2 id="the-book:387fd69b3fec7d6d8ae080b51a91f96e">The Book</h2>

<p>This book is an excellent resource for anyone looking to use RabbitMQ (or any other AMQP server for that matter&hellip;) for queuing/integration. Most modern software components <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing">pass messages</a> to other components, not data. I thoroughly enjoyed reviewing this book and learn some new RabbitMQ tricks in the process. The format uses a clean cookbook of recipe description, how to implement the recipe, and how the recipe works. It makes finding a solution to a queuing challenge a quick and easy process.</p>

<p>This book comprises over 265 pages and 70 recipes for a myriad of integration solutions. <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/authors/profiles/sigismondo-boschi">Sigismondo</a> and <a href="http://blog.indigenidigitali.com/tag/gabriele-santomaggio/">Gabriele</a> did a great job of showing code examples for Java, C#, Ruby as well as others languages. In addition to the examples, they also show how to properly manage a RabbitMQ server and deploy it to the cloud.</p>

<p>Here is a brief table of contents:</p>

<pre><code>1. Working with AMQP
2. Going beyond the AMQP Standard
3. Managing RabbitMQ
4. Mixing Different Technologies
5. Using RabbitMQ in Web Applications
6. Developing Scalable Applications
7. Developing High-Availability Applications
8. Performance Tuning for RabbitMQ
9. Extending RabbitMQ Functionality
10. RabbitMQ on AWS
11. AMQP and Cloud Computing - RabbitMQ on PAAS
12. Managing RabbitMQ Error Conditions
</code></pre>

<p>One of my favorite recipes in the book is for auto scaling RabbitMQ servers on AWS &ndash; it is a formula you can use for not only RabbitMQ but other EC2 instances on AWS.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion:387fd69b3fec7d6d8ae080b51a91f96e">Conclusion</h2>

<p>If you want a flexible/scalable backbone for your Enterprise application (or future Enterprise application) &ndash; RabbitMQ is a great option, and this book is a great head start for that option.</p>

<p>Technical reviewing is also a great way to get involved with a technology that you like!</p>
