I finished reading <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning">Pragmatic Thinking &amp; Learning: Refactor Your Wetware</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Hunt_%28author%29">Andy Hunt</a> a couple of days ago and I have been reflecting on it a lot lately. (Note: <a href="http://www.mindmeister.com/100157863/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning-refactor-your-wetware">here</a> is a very cool mind map of the books contents by <a href="http://www.mindmeister.com">MindMeister</a>) The major topics of the book are:</p>

<ol>
<li>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition">Dreyfus model of skill acquisition</a></li>
<li>Using your &lsquo;<a href="http://www.drawright.com/theory.htm">R-mode</a>&rsquo; of the brain</li>
<li>Learning deliberately</li>
<li>Gaining experience</li>
</ol>

<p>There are plenty of other items which Andy delves into throughout the book. It is very thoughtfully researched and written &ndash; and it is a <em>must</em> for any career software developer to read (Along with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">Clean Code</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Clean-Coder-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073">The Clean Coder</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1382726080&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=The+Pragmatic+Programmer">Pragmatic Programmer</a>).</p>

<h2 id="the-right-brain:b96c280e7a3c99f5d16814825f459996">The &lsquo;Right&rsquo; Brain</h2>

<p>{% img left /images/dreyfus-model.png 289 70 %}
At it&rsquo;s essence, the book points out that each of us have a different level of expertise in any skill we have  &ndash; be it programming, cooking, speaking, etc. The majority of people stay at a &lsquo;advance beginner&rsquo; level on the Dreyfus model and never really advance into the &lsquo;competent&rsquo;, &lsquo;proficient&rsquo; or &lsquo;expert&rsquo; levels of the model.  {% img right /images/left<em>right_brain.jpg 250 210 %}
I believe we should all aspire to achieve an &lsquo;expert&rsquo; level skills in the areas that correspond to our career field. In order to attain this level, we have to engage the <a href="http://www.drawright.com/theory.htm">R-mode</a> of our brain to leverage our experiences. The R-mode is the holistic, intuitive, creative portion of our brain. You can&rsquo;t access your R-mode as easily as the <a href="http://www.creativeglossary.com/art-mediums/left-side-of-the-brain-l-mode-characteristics.html">L-mode</a> &ndash; in fact, it typically is drown out by L-mode &lsquo;chatter&rsquo; (e.g. the constant stream of though that pops into your head like &lsquo;_I wonder what I should eat for lunch&hellip;</em>&rsquo;).</p>

<h2 id="intuition-and-the-expert:b96c280e7a3c99f5d16814825f459996">Intuition and the Expert</h2>

<p>{% img left /images/intuition<em>head.jpg 250 250 %}
Over the past couple of months I&rsquo;ve read quite a few technology related articles that seem to &ldquo;<a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/dovetail">dovetail</a>&rdquo; with the subject.  The book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(book)">Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Gladwell">Malcolm Gladwell</a> points to increasing scientific evidence of the R-mode of the brain using what is termed &lsquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin-slicing">thin-slicing</a>&rsquo; of events to generate what we think of as &lsquo;_intuition</em>&rsquo;. More often than not this intuition is correct &ndash; but it can be fooled by biases that the brain has.
{% img right /images/blink<em>book.jpg 180 360 %}
Intuition is one of the main items that gives an expert his/her expertise. It lets the expert arrive at a correct solution faster than any of the other levels of the Dreyfus model. _This speed and correctness is exactly what is needed to compete in our global economy</em>.<br />
We tend to discount intuition and the R-mode faculties because they can&rsquo;t be quantified as easily as say, passing a calculus exam with flying colors.</p>

<h2 id="rise-of-the-creative-economy:b96c280e7a3c99f5d16814825f459996">Rise of the Creative Economy</h2>

<p>{% img left /images/creativemind_illustrated.png 224 274 %}
A good part of &lsquo;due diligence&rsquo; for your career should be looking ahead to the horizon to see what is on it. One of the recurring themes I see in most publications is the future demand for &lsquo;creatives&rsquo; in most organizations. A <a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/2006/06/04/richard-florida/future-american-workforce-global-creative-economy">recent article</a> by the CATO institute points to the &lsquo;creative economy&rsquo; as the future of the american economy &ndash; while <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/elainepofeldt/2012/12/28/want-to-recession-proof-yourself-join-the-creative-class/">another article</a> by Forbes suggests joining the &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_class">creative class</a>&rdquo; as a way to recession proof yourself.</p>

<p>With all of the above in mind, how do we future-proof our careers in technology? I would start with reading <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning">Pragmatic Thinking &amp; Learning</a>. While you are reading it, I would do three things:</p>

<h3 id="1-determine-your-interests:b96c280e7a3c99f5d16814825f459996">1) Determine your interests</h3>

<p>I believe you should align your career with what your interests are. Figure out what you like to do. This can turn a &lsquo;job&rsquo; that you work into a &lsquo;career&rsquo; that you enjoy. Think about it: <a href="http://www.ask.com/question/what-percentage-of-our-lives-are-spent-working">roughly one third of your life is spent working</a> &ndash; you might as well be doing something you enjoy.<br />
When you are doing something you like and are interested in, it makes learning easier as well. The <a href="http://www.wired.com">Wired magazine</a> article <a href="http://www.wired.com/business/2013/10/free-thinkers/">&ldquo;Free Thinkers&rdquo;</a> (by Joshua Davis) references new teaching methods which leverage that interest/curiosity in different subjects to accelerate learning.</p>

<h3 id="2-practice-active-career-development:b96c280e7a3c99f5d16814825f459996">2) Practice active career development</h3>

<p>In order to attain competent, proficient or expert skill in a particular area you must deliberately and actively learn in the area. This means taking charge of your own professional development.</p>

<h4 id="if-you-are-a-programmer-technologist:b96c280e7a3c99f5d16814825f459996">If you are a programmer/technologist:</h4>

<p>{% img right /images/ruby_users_meeting1.jpg 300 148 %}
Don&rsquo;t wait for the company that you work for to send you to training or ask you to investigate a particular technology &ndash; go and learn it on your own.</p>

<p>With all of the demands of a busy life, this means <strong>you</strong> are going to need to set time aside to learn the subject. If you don&rsquo;t schedule it and abide by the schedule it probably won&rsquo;t get done.</p>

<p>Here are some suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read a new technology book (or two)<br /></li>
<li>Play around with a new framework or language<br /></li>
<li>Get involved in maintaining an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">OSS</a> project.<br /></li>
</ul>

<p>Find the learning technique that works best for you. We have so many learning resources today (thanks in large part to the proliferation of Internet technologies). Here are a few:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOCs</a> ( <a href="http://www.edx.org/">edX</a>, <a href="http://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a>, <a href="http://www.udacity.com">Udacity</a>, et al. )<br /></li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> HowTo videos<br /></li>
<li>Technology related blogs &amp; sites<br /></li>
<li>Tutorial &amp; Learning Sites ( <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com">PluralSight</a>, <a href="http://www.codeschool.com">CodeSchool</a>, <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">CodeAcademy</a>, <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/">TreeHouse</a> et al. )<br /></li>
</ul>

<p>My personal favorite learning technique: <strong>get involved in a local user group</strong>. Surround yourself with others who are actively learning: <em>Exchange ideas.</em> <em>Network.</em> Give a talk on a technology that you like! Nothing hammers a topic home better than having to teach it.</p>

<p>I highly recommend making your own &ldquo;<a href="http://nohack.eingenetzt.com/character-building/pragmatic-investment-plan/">Pragmatic Investment Plan</a>&rdquo; to practice career development.</p>

<h3 id="3-engage-your-creative-side:b96c280e7a3c99f5d16814825f459996">3) Engage your creative side</h3>

<p>{% img left /images/sketching-the-branding-process.jpg 200 196 %}
In order to use the R-mode thinking you need to work at engaging your creative side actively. <em>The R-mode can only be invited&ndash;not compelled&ndash;to work on a problem.</em> The L-mode of your brain will drown out the R-mode in most cases. You must find ways to silence the L-mode chatter and allow the R-mode to &ldquo;do it&rsquo;s thing&rdquo;&trade;.</p>

<p>The ways to do this are too numerous to list in a blog post &ndash; so here are just a few:</p>

<ul>
<li>Draw a picture of the problem you are trying to solve. What visual metaphor is appropriate?</li>
<li>Describe problems verbally {% img right /images/meditation_pic.jpg 200 200 %}</li>
<li>Use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map">mindmaps</a> when brainstorming</li>
<li>Use a walk as a way to clear the L-mode &lsquo;chatter&rsquo;</li>
<li>Try acting out a process rather than diagramming it</li>
<li>Doodle in your idle time or during a phone call</li>
<li>Keep a dream log</li>
<li>Take up daily meditation</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion:b96c280e7a3c99f5d16814825f459996">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Managing <strong>your</strong> career is <strong>your</strong> own responsibility. {% img left /images/footprints_sand.jpg 200 %} Take an active role in this portion of your life and never quit striving to learn more.</p>
