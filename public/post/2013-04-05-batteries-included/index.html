            <p>I usually use a desktop PC and my Macbook Air on a daily basis during the week. In going back and forth between Windows and Mac OS X, I have noticed a couple of things that have hammered home the point that hardware is not the only thing Apple does well &ndash; software is too.
&lt;!&ndash; more &ndash;&gt;
{% img left /images/password_protect_files_snowleopard.jpg 350 Save as PDF on Mac %}
The first thing that occurred to me is Mac OS X has had the ability to print and edit PDF files at least since Mac OS X Leopard. With Windows, I need to download some type of PDF print driver and an Adobe viewer. Mac OS X has preview (which works for both images and PDF files), which will let me view and do some light editing on a PDF file as wells annotate.</p>

<p>{% img right /images/notification-center.jpg Mac OS Notification Center %}
The second thing I noticed was Mac OS X Lions notifications center provides not only a nice area to see your email and app notifications, but also an easy way to post to Twitter and Facebook. Growl notification is baked in as well &ndash; I have to download a growl client for windows (and the app has to use Growl).</p>

<p>I am not quite sure why Windows doesn&rsquo;t have &ldquo;batteries included&rdquo; when it comes to PDF files, but it is just a nice feature that Apple has added into Mac OS X. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong: I have used Windows for a long time &ndash; and I was a Windows user before I used a Mac. Windows gets a lot of things right and I will continue to use Windows as well &ndash; but Apple seems to be getting very good at sanding down the &ldquo;friction points&rdquo; you encounter with software to make for an easier, elegant user experience.</p>

<p>Sometimes its just nice for things to work as you intend them to and to serendipitously find some functionality that is often overlooked&hellip;</p>
