<p>{% img left /images/hanselman.jpg Scott Hanselman %}
Last night I did the first tech talk (<a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a> and <a href="http://easynetq.com/">EasyNetQ</a>) that I have done in at least a one or two years at the <a href="http://www.hrnug.org/">Hampton Roads .NET Users Group (HRNUG)</a>.</p>

<p>I try to have respect for my audience when giving these talks and work
provide them with something that is entertaining as well as
educational. I wouldn’t want my time wasted with a bad presentation – so I don’t want to waste the audience’s time either! In giving my talks, I strive to emulate the great tech speakers and educators like <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/">Scott Hanselman</a> and <a href="http://www.8thlight.com/our-team/robert-martin">‘Uncle Bob’ Martin</a>.
&lt;!&ndash; more &ndash;&gt;</p>

<p><a href="http://wekeroad.com/">Rob Connery</a> does a great interview of Scott Hanselman in his Full Throttle series on Tekpub on <a href="http://tekpub.com/productions/ft_speaker">how Scott prepares for a tech talk</a>. If you are serious about giving tech talks, I highly recommend you look at it.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-learned:0b079ec9875d52687a2f6c6364aa59cd">What I learned</h2>

<p>Tech talks can through you some curve-balls that; if you are willing to pay attention, can provide some teachable moments that you can use to refine future tech talks. I found my teachable moments in a couple of areas while giving the presentation:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make sure to use your phone or watch as a timer – to help you keep the ‘pace’ through your tech talk. Setting it to the max talk time and having it count down will work – or have a half way point set and check to see where you are in the total presentation I was allotted 60 – 75 minutes, but my talk came in at around 45 minutes because I though I was running out of time. These extra minutes could have been used to dive deeper into my code examples!</p></li>

<li><p>If you haven’t been playing with PowerPoint lately, <a href="http://presentationsoft.about.com/od/powerpoint101/ss/shortcuts.htm">brush up on the start (F5) / restart (SHIFT-F5) keystrokes</a>. When you are in the middle of a presentation, it can disrupt the flow of the talk when you have to forward to the last slide you where one. I rehearsed my talk, except I didn’t rehearse switching into my demos. While F5 will start a slideshow in Power Point, it always starts at the beginning. In the middle of the talk, I couldn’t remember what the restart keystroke was, so I had to forward from the beginning slide each time I stopped for a demo. This can be a little choppy for the viewers.</p></li>

<li><p>If you use any other tools, such as <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897434.aspx">ZoomIt</a> – make sure you set their key mappings to what you want them to be and make sure you practice using it in your talk rehearsal.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Fortunately I get a do-over next month with the <a href="http://757rb.org/">757 Ruby Users Group</a>. I have some tweaking to do to the presentation in order to tailor it for a slightly different audience, but the changes are really just the demos and substituting the <a href="https://github.com/ruby-amqp/amqp">amqp gem</a> for EasyNetQ. But my lessons learned on the presentation flow will definitely be incorporated.</p>

<p>I am sure there will be many more of these teachable moments in the future…</p>
