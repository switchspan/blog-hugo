OK: I like Windows 8 so far. I think it is a pretty good OS. My only gripe with it so far is that lately it has been stalling on the updates. 

The screen will say something to the effect of "Do not power down" and "Installing update 4 of 6". It will do this for several hours...with occasional hard disk activity. Eventually I have to pull the battery on my laptop to restart it. 

I am thinking: Really??
