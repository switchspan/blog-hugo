My name is Ken Taylor and this blog is my spot for writing mainly about programming and technology (yes, I know there are already more than enough of this type of blog…). Hopefully I will have an occasional humorous post. 

I am a software developer from Virginia Beach, VA. I have used quite a few different technologies and have (hopefully) grown as a professional in the process.

## About SwitchSpan

SwitchSpan is just a name I picked for the blog and my Github
account. I just like the sound of the name and it really has no
other relevance. :)
If you are curious, this blog was writting using SublimeText 2, and published via
[Hugo](http://gohugo.io/)/[Github Pages](http://pages.github.com). The theme is a slightly modified copy of the [casper](https://github.com/vjeantet/hugo-theme-casper) theme by [Valere JEANTET](http://vjeantet.fr).
